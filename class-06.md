# NODE.JS
## Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

## The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers,

## You can check that Node is installed on your system by opening a terminal and typing node -v. If all has gone well, you should see something like v12.14.1 displayed. This is the current LTS version at the time of writing.

## Node comes bundled with a package manager called npm. To check which version you have installed on your system, type npm -v, In addition to being the package manager for JavaScript, npm is also the world’s largest software registry. There are over 1,000,000 packages of JavaScript code available to download, with billions of downloads per week.

## We can also install packages locally to a project, as opposed to globally, on our system. Create a test folder and open a terminal in that directory using ( npm init -y )
### This will create and auto-populate a package.json file in the same folder. Next, use npm to install the lodash package and save it as a project dependency: npm install express (for example ).

### Node.JS They can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.

### If you want to start developing apps with any modern JavaScript framework like React or Angular, you’ll be expected to have a working knowledge of Node and npm .

## Node.js Lets Us Run JavaScript on the Server.

### Node is particularly suited to building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration — for example, chat sites, or apps such as CodeShare, where you can watch a document being edited live by someone else. It’s also a good fit for building APIs where you’re handling lots of requests that are I/O driven.
